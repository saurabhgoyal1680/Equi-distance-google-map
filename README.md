Equi distance google map
-------------------------
There are 3 files in the folder

1. markingMaps.html : It includes a basic structure of the html page on which we are rendering our map
2. style.css: It includes the basic style of the html page
3. index.js: It has the main logic to get the map directions and to put marking on the map. For now it only has a single js file but that can be separated into helper.js and main.js to make it more readable and easy to debug.

- To run this locally just click on the markingMaps.html file. It'll open the html file into default browser. Now populate the origin and destination fields.

- Choose a marking distance (in meters) of your own choice. Default value for marking distance is 50 meters if nothing is provided as input.
